Aimybox can reply not only with text. Any reply can contain audio which should be played by the user's device.

Every HTTP API response can contain multiple audio replies. Here is a list of the audio type reply fields

**url** - direct URL of the audio to be played

```
{
  "type": "audio",
  "url": "https://someaddress.com/sound.mp3"
}
```
